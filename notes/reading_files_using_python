files in python
===================
# opening a file
file = open("spider.txt")

# read line by line and need to close manually using file.close()
file.readline() # first line
file.readline() # second line
file.close()

# read whole file using readline and to do automatic file.close by python
with open("spider.txt") as file:
    print(file.readline())

#read the file using read
file.read()
file.close()

# line by line
for line in file:
    print(line.upper()) # to upper case
# this adds a new line \n after each and every line 

# to remove the new line \n after every line
for line in file:
    print(line.strip().upper())

# we can store in list
file = open("spider.txt")
lines = file.readlines()
file.close()
lines.sort()
print(lines)    # print in all the lines in ["..","..."] format

\n-> new line
\t-> tab space
