Signaling:
    Tokens delivered to running processes to indicate a desired action.
Ex:
>>ping www.exampe.com
it sends ICMP packets
Ctrl + C to stop

>>ping www.google.com
>>fg

SIGINT: Signal interrupt (Ctrl +c or Ctrl+z)
SIGSTOP: Signal that we sent is called SIGSTOP

fg: command that makes our program runs once more
kill: it will send a signal SIGTERM that tells the program to terminate.
    we need to know the process id (PID)
    we need to execute kill in a separate terminal
ps: to get the process
ps ax: list of all running processes in the current computer

lets run ping www.example.com
to know by name (ex:ping) in another terminal
>> ps ax | grep ping 
    we will get the pid and the details (ex 4619)
now lets kill that
>>kill 4619
