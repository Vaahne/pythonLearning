WhiteBox testing
------------------
clear-box or transparent testing
    Relies on test creator's knowledge of the software being tested to construct the test cases.

    The test creator know how it works and the testcases to understand everything working 

helps tester to test all the edge cases
Tests are created alongside the code development.
Tester is familiar with the code
Code is open-source

Black box testing (software being tested is treated as opaque box)
------------------
    the tester doesn not know how the internals how the software works.

    Balckbox testing is written with an awareness of what the program is supposed to do.
        - its requirements and specifications
        - but not how it does

Code is opaque
tester is not aware of the code

unit tests can be both white or black box testing   

Integration test
--------------------
    verifies interaction between different pieces of code in integrated environment are working way expected to.

    Group to test(group of unit tests together integrated)

Regression test
--------------------
    Its a varient of unit tests .

    Usually written as part of debugging and troubleshooting process to verify issue or error has been fixed once it is identified.

    this ensures same mistake doesnt happen twice.

    Same bug cannot be introduced again, it causes regression test to fail.


Smoke test
---------------
    Build verification test.
    While writing software smoke test serve as a kind of sanity check to find major bugs in a program.

    It answers basic questions like ,does the program run?

    If smoke test fails, its pretty sure that none of the others pass either.
    
    Running a piece of software code as-is to see if it runs.

Load test
------------------
    It verifies whether system behaves well when it is in significant load


Automatic testing: A process where software checks itself for errors and confirms that it works correctly

Black-box tests: A test where there is an awareness of what the program is supposed to do but not how it does it

Edge cases: Inputs to code that produce unexpected results, found at the extreme ends of the ranges of input

Pytest: A powerful Python testing tool that assists programmers in writing more effective and stable programs

Software testing: A process of evaluating computer code to determine whether or not it does what is expected

Test case: This is the individual unit of testing that looks for a specific response to a set of inputs

Test fixture: This prepared to perform one or more tests

Test suite: This is used to compile tests that should be executed together

Test runner: This runs the test and provides developers with the outcomeâ€™s data

unittest: A set of Python tools to construct and run unit tests

Unit tests: A test to verify that small isolated parts of a program work correctly

White-box test: A test where test creator knows how the code works and can write test cases that use the understanding to make sure it performs as expected
