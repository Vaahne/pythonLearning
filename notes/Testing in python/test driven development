Test driven development(TDD):
    calls the test before writing the code.

Life cycle:
    writing the test first
    running it , to make it fail
    once failed , write the code 
    run the test again
    if passes, next part , 
    if fails, debug and fix

Advantages of TDD:
    Test cases written before writing code.
    Test while you develop code.
    A problem is well thought out.
